			<p class="text-xl font-medium">Designing Within the Framework</p>
			<p>
				When I began designing Recording Studio, the goal was to create something new — but not
				unfamiliar. We wanted users to feel immediately comfortable, even as we introduced an
				entirely new workflow.
			</p>
			<p>
				To achieve this, I anchored the experience in Goldcast's <b>existing event framework</b>,
				reusing familiar layouts, navigation, and patterns where it made sense. At the same time, I
				introduced <b>new recording-specific elements and interactions</b> that supported a guided, creator-first
				workflow.
			</p>
			<p>
				The result was a balance between familiarity and innovation: a recording environment that
				felt seamlessly integrated into the platform, yet purpose-built for planning, capturing, and
				refining great content.

				One of the core design challenges was creating a <b>truly seamless, end-to-end workflow</b> that
