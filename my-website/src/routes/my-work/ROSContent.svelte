				In the early days of virtual events, bringing content live with a click felt effortless. But

				firing at once, that magic faded. What should’ve been seamless became a maze of panels,
				tabs, and timing risks.

			<p class="text-xl font-medium">The Untold Burden on Event Producers</p>
			<p>
				Goldcast's live event platform helps producers and speakers manage and present content like
				slide decks, videos, and other media during virtual sessions.
			</p>
			<p>
				But that's only part of the job — producers are also juggling a suite of engagement tools
				like live chat, Q&A, and polls, all while coordinating guest speakers and managing layout
				changes in real time.
			</p>
			<p class="font-bold">
				Before the Run of Show feature, event teams had no single, reliable way to plan and execute
				their session flow within Goldcast. Managing content was slow, manual, and
				error-prone—especially under live-event pressure.
			</p>
			<p class="">
				The goal was to create a <span class="rounded-lg bg-[#fae2d3]/50 px-1 font-bold"
					>centralized, intuitive control panel</span
				> that allows producers to plan and execute their entire event timeline with minimal clicks and
				cognitive load, resulting in maximum confidence

				<p class="text-xl font-bold">The Research</p>
				<p>
					To better understand the problem space, I began with a competitive analysis. One key
					insight stood out: <span class="rounded-lg bg-[#fae2d3]/50 px-1 font-bold"
						>no other platform offered a unified way to manage all the moving parts of a live event</span
					>. This confirmed that ROS could be a key differentiator for Goldcast—solving a gap others
					hadn't addressed.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also conducted seven <span class="rounded-lg bg-[#fae2d3]/50 px-1 font-bold"
						>customer interviews</span
					> to explore how teams currently manage their live events.

					In Goldcast, producers can duplicate an event to re-run repeat sessions, and many requested
					that their Run of Show automatically copy over with it. While clearly valuable, engineering
					flagged it as a heavy lift that would expand scope. To keep the release on track, I made the
					call to
					<span class="w-fit rounded-lg bg-[#fae2d3]/50 px-1 font-bold"
						>defer ROS duplication for beta</span

					and schedule it for

					As we approached the closed beta, navigating the build revealed remaining open

				Early feedback has been incredibly positive.

				One customer shared, <span class="w-fit rounded-lg bg-[#fae2d3]/50 px-1 font-bold"
					>“It was so helpful! It alleviated a lot of my webinar admin anxiety.”</span

				That really captured the core goal of this project: reducing stress in high-pressure, live-event
				moments.

			<p class="font-bold">More early feedback:</p>
			<p class="w-fit rounded-lg bg-[#fae2d3]/50 p-2 font-bold">
				“Oh my god that ROS in the platform was life changing. Thank you for adding this.”

			<p class="w-fit rounded-lg bg-[#fae2d3]/50 p-2 font-bold">
				“I wouldn't do a webinar without a run of show anymore… I would be sad to do a webinar

				</p>

				<p>
					I've used it for two events now — one of our usual hour-long sessions and our big six-hour
					summit — and it completely changed how I prep and run shows. I used to rely on messy docs
					and huge spreadsheets, but during the summit, I realized I didn't even need to open them
					because everything was already in the Run of Show.
				</p>

				<p>
					It made collaboration so much easier, too. Instead of dumping a confusing spreadsheet on
					my co-producer, I could just say, 'Everything's in the Run of Show.' Overall, total dream
					— I love it.”

				Hearing that level of enthusiasm—especially from power users who run events every
